  <h2 class="inblk">what do we do?</h2>
  <p class="trebuchet">
    we are trying to make some sense out of the content explosion on the web..<br/>
    with so much content being produced, we thought it would be useful to find the most talked about stories, links, pictures, videos, etc..<br/>
    our first stop is twitter which we find to be an incredible source of content on everything under the sun..
  </p>
  <hr class='hbr' />
  <h2 class="inblk">got products?</h2>
  <p class="trebuchet">
    yes, we got..our first attempt is <a href="http://inagist.com/" target="_blank" title="in-a-gist">inagist</a> (in a gist), to provide people with a gist of what is happening on twitter..<br/>
    please do visit and let us know what you think..

  <h2 class="inblk">what is iyotta?</h2>
  <p class="trebuchet">
    a desperate attempt at trying to be smart, geeky and different...<br/>
    mathematically speaking, it is<br/>
      <i class="georgia inblk">iota(&#953;) &#60; &#953;yotta &#60; yotta <sup>*</sup></i>
    <br/>
    and since we are trying to reduce mountains of data to small mole-hills, we thought it all made sense!!

  <sup class="georgia note inblk">* 1 yotta byte = a gazillion bytes</sup>
